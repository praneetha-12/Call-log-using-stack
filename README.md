# Call-log-using-stack
Implementation of basic call logging using stack data structure in C language.


ABSTRACT
 
A call log or call history is a record of any telephone calls made, received or missed to or from a phone. The log contains information such as date, duration and contact (name or number). A missed call is a telephone call that is deliberately terminated by the caller before being answered by its intended recipient, in order to communicate a pre-agreed message. It is a form of one-bit messaging. Missed calls are common in emerging markets where mobile phones with limited outgoing calls are widely used; as the call is not actually completed and connected, it does not carry a cost to the caller, hence they can conserve their remaining prepaid credit. Missed calls are especially prominent in India. Expanding upon their use as a communications method, they have been adopted as a form of marketing communications, in which users can "missed call" specific numbers and receive a call or text back that contains advertising and other content. The concept of “CALLING HISTORY” lets you view the missed calls you have and helps you call them back if you want to.


CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION


1.1 Introduction to the topic

Call logging is the process of collecting, analyzing, and recording data on telephone calls. The data can include the call origin, call destination, the length of the call, and other transmission details. Other characteristics might include the call start and end times and the specific network used. Call logs are typically saved by a telecommunications service or equipment provider as a "call detail record." This process is automated and call logs can be stored for later review.


1.2 Software

The goal of the call logging software is to interpret the raw CDR data and produce graphical and summarizing reports. Call logging software packages differ in the sizes of PBX systems that they can support, from hundreds of extensions to hundreds of thousands of extensions. They also differ in the capability of logging specific types of events or data and support for specialized PBX features. In general terms, call logging reports can highlight such areas as:
•	Cost Control – cost of calls, cost of trunk lines, costs by department or individual extension, number of unused extensions, etc. Call logging software can also discover instances of Telephone fraud.
•	Performance Management – looks at how long it is taking an organization to answer phone calls by operator, department or extension and demonstrates whether they meet acceptable target levels for that organization.
•	Capacity Management – judges whether the system is being over or under utilized. It examines trunk usage and call patterns that show where extra capacity is required or where cost savings can be achieved.
•	QoS Reporting – modern VoIP PBXs are able to output quality of service data in addition to standard CDRs. An up-to-date call logging package should be able to include this data along with its other reports to help monitor and improve system performance.

At its core, a call log software records and presents data about the operator and department that makes or takes the calls. This means that both inbound and outbound telecommunications are tracked and recorded down to a T with an effective call logging software.


1.3 Uses

These data points do not record the content of the call itself, but still can provide valuable information. Call logs provide a macro view of how a telecommunications network is being used in real time. That data can be used to reduce costs by prioritizing service to the busiest areas of the network. Call logs can ensure the most effective deployment of maintenance resources to keep a network operating at peak efficiency.

Call log data can serve a variety of users. Telecommunications companies use call log data to evaluate the performance of their network and ability to serve customers. The origin and destination of calls can help determine how to provide coverage during periods of peak use. Retail call centers use call logs to evaluate the performance of customer service representatives. Longer call durations typically mean more time spent to resolve issues, and vice versa. Emergency service agencies use call logs to monitor disaster zones and provide targeted assistance. Call logs allow companies to understand their network usage and provide the best possible coverage.

LITERATURE SURVEY


2.1 The Department

The call log software records incoming and outgoing calls on a departmental level. Knowing at a large scale the frequency, promptness, and quality of service delivered by the department will help companies make informed changes in the future. If calls are constantly being rerouted to a certain department, employers could analyse the recordings and find out how to better distribute their calls.

2.2 The Operator

The call log software also records the operators themselves. This feature helps companies ensure high-quality customer service or support, and gives room for future employee training.

2.3 The Conversation Length

In many cases, there are no limits as to how long the recordings could last. The software can automatically log both inbound and outbound calls at a high volume level, suitable for any and all company sizes. Knowing the length of these calls and having the exact dialogues at hand, employers could better customize their IVR systems to offer more troubleshooting/self-help options (which consumers prefer).

IVR systems are Interactive Voice Response systems

2.4 Information on unanswered calls

Usually, call logging only logs the phone number of unanswered calls. But there are certain apps which let you in on crucial information on callers without even having to pick up the call. It details things like: caller location, phone number, demographics, and keywords that drove the call. Companies also have the option to customize these analytics to fit their needs.


CHAPTER 3
PROPOSED SYSTEM

Business telephony went through a massive transformation with the introduction of cloud-based VoIP phone systems. And while the utility of call center analytics is no secret, the availability of call logging systems in VoIP solutions in general has been steadily increasing.  These systems enable advanced reporting, analytics, tracking, and so much more.
Nowadays, all of the best business VoIP providers include a robust call logging system as part of their business phone plans.  Call logging systems contain valuable data such as the phone number, caller account number, time of the call, call duration, reason for call, call resolution, and even a caller’s device.
